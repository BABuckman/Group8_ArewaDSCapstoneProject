3. Project title: Improving Binary Classification of Tomato Leaf Health in Northern Nigeria Using Transfer Learning on TomatoEbola Dataset. 

4. General Information: 
This project proposes a robust, efficient deep learning pipeline for classifying tomato leaf health using the TomatoEbola dataset â€” a real-world dataset collected from Yobe State. Building on prior Vision Transformer (ViT)-based work, we focus on improving inference efficiency, model generalization, and real-world usability by fine- tuning lightweight pre-trained models such as MobileNetV3 and EfficientNet. The final model will be deployed via a web interface and tracked using Weights & Biases (WandB) to support agricultural diagnostics.

5. Dataset:
